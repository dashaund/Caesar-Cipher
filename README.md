# Caesar-Cipher
A simple program that takes a positive, non-zero integer key of any length and a string to encode using Caesar's cipher. It will print the simplified key (between 1 and 26), the encrypted message, and it will run such message through a decrypt function to also print the original message back.



# USAGE

Run caesar_main.py script with the key as an argument in the terminal. The key must be a non-zero positive integer and can be of any length. After that you will be prompted to enter the message you seek to encode. The program will print to screen the simplified key (between 1 and 26), the encoded message and the decoded message in that order.
